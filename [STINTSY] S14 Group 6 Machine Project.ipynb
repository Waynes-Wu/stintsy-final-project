    "This notebook explores the Philippine Statistics Authority's (PSA) Labor Force Survey 2016, a comprehensive dataset that offers insights into the Philippine labor market. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model development to predict key labor outcomes. Three distinct machine learning models are trained and evaluated, followed by error analysis and hyperparameter tuning to improve performance. Finally, the project concludes with a summary of findings and insights drawn from the analysis.   "

    "The Labor Force Survey (LFS) is a nationwide quarterly survey conducted by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) to gather labor market statistics. It provides insights into the levels and trends of employment, unemployment, and underemployment in the Philippines. The data serves as a quantitative framework for developing labor-related policies and programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the April 2016 LFS, data collection was carried out between April 8, 2016, and April 30, 2016. The survey followed a structured methodology to ensure data accuracy and reliability. The sampling design was based on the 2013 Master Sample Design, ensuring comprehensive representation at both the national and regional levels. Data collection was conducted through face-to-face interviews using standardized questionnaires. The process was closely supervised by Regional Directors (RDs) and Provincial Statistics Officers (PSOs) to ensure consistency and adherence to survey protocols. The survey targeted household members aged 15 and older, focusing on individuals within the labor force.\n",
    "This rigorous data collection process enhances the reliability of the survey's findings, making it a valuable resource for policymakers, economists, and researchers examining the Philippine labor market.\n",
    "\n",
